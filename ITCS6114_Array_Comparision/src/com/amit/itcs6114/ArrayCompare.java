 * ITCS 6114 Problem Statement
 * 1. You are given n telephone bills and m checks sent to pay the bills (n â‰¥ m). Assuming that telephone numbers are written on the checks, find out who failed to pay.  
 * (For simplicity, you may also assume that only one check is written for a particular bill and that it covers the bill in full)
